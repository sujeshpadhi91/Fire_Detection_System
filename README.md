﻿The objective of this project is to use transfer learning and use a pre-trained model named YOLOv8 for fire detection from images.

Steps to Begin:

Download the fire.zip from the google drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtCrOn2jE1Pdhqru5S9oQ3KVoxECFNSL/view?usp=share_link) and place the zipped folder in your local github repository directory.
Open the project.py file on your code editor for next steps.
