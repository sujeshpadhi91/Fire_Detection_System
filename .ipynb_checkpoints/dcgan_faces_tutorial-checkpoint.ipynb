    "\n",
    "### What is a GAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of neural network architecture that consists of two separate networks working in conjunction: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network is trained to generate synthetic data samples that resemble the training data, while the discriminator network is trained to distinguish between real and fake data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training process, the generator network tries to generate realistic data samples that can fool the discriminator network into thinking they are real, while the discriminator network tries to correctly classify the real and fake data samples. As a result of this adversarial training process, the generator network gradually improves its ability to generate increasingly realistic data samples, while the discriminator network becomes better at identifying fake data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are commonly used for generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, and text generation, among others. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to generate high-quality, realistic data samples that can be used for various applications, including art, entertainment, and data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a DCGAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as the generator and a deep CNN as the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "DCGANs were introduced to improve the quality of images generated by GANs. They use convolutional layers in the generator network to learn hierarchical representations of images and produce high-quality images with rich details and textures. Additionally, DCGANs use convolutional layers in the discriminator network to enable it to learn more complex decision boundaries and better distinguish between real and fake images.\n",
    "\n",
    "DCGANs have become a popular model for image synthesis tasks and have been used to generate realistic images of objects, animals, and even human faces. They have also been used in style transfer tasks, where the generator network is trained to convert images from one style to another, such as turning a photograph into a painting. Overall, DCGANs have significantly improved the quality and realism of generated images and have paved the way for many exciting applications of GANs in computer vision and graphics.\n"

    "### Phase 2. Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning to increase the size and diversity of a training dataset without actually collecting new data. This technique involves applying various transformations to the existing data, resulting in modified versions of the original data samples that can be used for training.\n",

    "Data augmentation is an important technique for improving the generalization and robustness of deep learning models, including DCGANs. The purpose of data augmentation is to improve the generalization and robustness of the machine learning model by exposing it to a wider range of variations in the input data. By randomly applying different transformations, such as rotations, translations, scaling, flipping, and adding noise, the model learns to recognize and generate variations of the same image, even if they appear in different poses, orientations, or lighting conditions.\n",

    "The code defines a Discriminator class, which is a neural network model that takes an image as input and outputs a single scalar value representing whether the input image is real or fake. Here are the main points of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-The class inherits from the nn.Module class, which is a base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-The ngpu parameter specifies the number of GPUs to use for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-The main sequential container is defined to contain the layers of the neural network. The container is defined using nn.Sequential, which is a container that allows you to chain together multiple layers in a sequential manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-The neural network consists of several layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) followed by batch normalization layers, leaky ReLU activation functions, and a final sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-The input image is first passed through a 2D convolutional layer (nn.Conv2d) with ndf output channels, a kernel size of 4, a stride of 2, and padding of 1. The resulting feature map is then passed through a leaky ReLU activation function with a negative slope of 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "6-This process is repeated several times with increasing numbers of output channels (ndf * 2, ndf * 4, ndf * 8) until a final 2D convolutional layer with a single output channel (nn.Conv2d(ndf * 8, 1, 4, 1, 0)) is reached. This final layer outputs a scalar value between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid activation function (nn.Sigmoid()), which represents the discriminator's confidence in the input image being real.\n",
    "\n",
    "7-Batch normalization layers (nn.BatchNorm2d) are added after each convolutional layer to normalize the inputs and stabilize the training process. Leaky ReLU activation functions are used instead of regular ReLU functions to allow for a small amount of negative activation values, which can help prevent the \"dying ReLU\" problem in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8-The forward method takes an input tensor (input) representing the image and passes it through the layers defined in the main sequential container to produce the discriminator's output. The method returns the output tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "9-During training, the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and fake images by adjusting the weights of its layers through backpropagation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n",

    "As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\n",

    "Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\n",
